                <ul>
                    <li>As a company, we get reimbursed through multiple methods, sometimes we get paid through commission, other times are a flat fee, and/or 			through a subscriptions model…. YET insurance companies do not pass these commissions cost to consumers, think of them as  a
                        marketing fee for providing the insurance company with a beneficiary/customer. Some companies choose to spend this marketing budget 		on 		a GECKO, lady name FLO, the Bad Luck Guy, and others use a General.</li>
                    <li>We try to focus on providing value to the relationship of insurance and consumers, to keep you coming back.</li>

                <p>Yes, in the United States and in many countries to provide insurance products,
                    the sell entity and many of its employees need to be licensed & insured. We are no different.</p>

                Is it cheaper to buy insurance through Goods & Healths Insured?

                <ul>
                    <li>Simple answer is NO….. As a sales, administrator and representative of multiple carriers we do not have authority to control price from insurance carriers. Our prices are not cheaper or any more expensive; all things being equal; if you go with us or if you go with the insurance carrier directly.</li>
                    <li>The mathematical computations & variables use to get to a price are managed by insurance carriers DIRECTLY, cannot change often and needs to be submitted to state regulators yearly. As an added bonus, is illegal to altered insurance prices that have been authorized by state regulators.</li>
